Praying on Biotech companies' downfall to generate profit.

##Theory

Most Biotech companies and startups aspire to create revolutionary treatments but very few actually succeed because groundbreaking innovation is rare and clinical trials have a high failure rate (3 stages of possible failures).

#Based on multiple studies on clinical trials

phase 1 -> phase 2 : success rate of ~63%
phase 2 -> phase 3 : success rate of ~30%
phase 3 -> market approval (NDA/BLA) : success rate of ~58%

Let A be approved, P1 phase 1, P2 phase 2, P3 phase 3
P(A) = P(P1->P2) x P(P2->P3) x P(P3 -> market)
P(A) = 0.63 x 0.3 x 0.58
P(A) = 0.10962 -> ~0.11 or 11%

According to the result, 11% or 1 in 10 drugs that start phase 1 ever make it to market approval, meaning ~90% ultimately fail somewhere along the pipeline. - see Disclaimer*

#Conclusion

Trading on their failure gives us a ~90% win rate. - see Discalimer**


## Disclaimer

* The overall clinical trial success rate shown in this project is calculated using the multiplication of phase-to-phase transition probabilities (e.g., Phase 1 → 2, 2 → 3, 3 → Market Approval). While this method provides a useful estimate, it assumes conditional independence between phases, meaning each phase's success rate is treated independently based on entry into that phase. In reality, clinical trial outcomes may be correlated across phases due to shared risks, drug properties, trial design flaws, or biological limitations. Therefore, these calculations represent generalized averages, not guarantees of individual drug outcomes.
** This platform assumes a rational edge based on historical treatment failure rate, not guaranteed outcomes. While ~90% of drugs fail before approval, real trades can still be volatile and unpredictable. The information provided is for general informational and educational purposes only.
